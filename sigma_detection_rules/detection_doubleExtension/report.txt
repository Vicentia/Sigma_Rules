Because Windows is really often not including one of the extensions, it is a challange to notice a double extension download that most of the time it is malicious, so I decided to create this rule. I started by sending a double extension dummy file: 
Invoke-WebRequest "https://example.com" -OutFile "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Downloads\photo.jpg.scr" and for writing the script IO tried to include as many double extension as I could find because most of the time they hide malicious code. Unfortunatly, this script does not recognize all the possible double extensions that can b, but it is mean to trigger an alarm all the time when a known double extension is encountered.
